# Real-Time Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System ðŸŽ¶ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¡

This project is a real-time music recommendation system that detects a userâ€™s emotions using facial recognition and plays music that aligns with their current mood. By analyzing emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and calmness, it enhances the listening experience by suggesting songs to match the listener's mood.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to leverage computer vision and machine learning to recommend songs based on real-time emotion detection. Itâ€™s designed to:
- Detect emotions from facial expressions via webcam input.
- Analyze detected emotions to recommend mood-based music.
- Provide users with a personalized listening experience.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection:** Uses a camera feed to recognize emotions in real-time.
- **Mood-Based Music Recommendation:** Recommends and plays songs matching detected emotions.
- **Seamless Spotify Integration:** Retrieves mood-based music suggestions via the Spotify API.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, intuitive interface to enhance user interaction.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow or PyTorch for emotion detection
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV for face tracking and image processing
- **Spotify API:** `spotipy` for music recommendations
- **Other Libraries:** `dlib`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas
